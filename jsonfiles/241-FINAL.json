Ports that are assigned to different VLANs cannot communicate unless interVLAN routing has been configured. In this example, you will need to configure interVLAN routing on RouterA.<br> Because a ping from Wrk2 to Wrk3 works, you know that Wrk2 has a valid connection to the switch, which means the cable is good and port security is allowing Wrk2 to connect to the switch. A ping from Wrk1 to Wrk2 would not require a default gateway setting on either device. You configure access lists on a router, not on a switch.

In some cases, convergence can be almost instantaneous because an EIGRP router stores backup routes for destinations. If no appropriate route or backup exists in the routing table, EIGRP will query neighbor routers to discover an alternate route. In this manner, EIGRP can quickly adapt to alternate routes when changes occur. <br>Automatic classful route summarization at major network boundaries is the default in EIGRP. Unlike IGRP and RIP, manual route summarization can also be configured on arbitrary network boundaries to reduce the routing table size. <br>Low use of network resources. During normal operation EIGRP transmits only hello packets across the network. EIGRP does not send periodic routing updates like RIP and IGRP. When change occurs, only routing table changes are propagated in EIGRP not the entire table. This minimizes bandwidth usage. <br>Multiple protocol support. EIGRP can exchange routes for IP, AppleTalk and IPX/SPX networks. <br>OSPF, not EIGRP is an open standard, operates within a controlled hierarchy, performs automatic classless route summarization, and uses areas.",

In some cases, convergence can be almost instantaneous because an EIGRP router stores backup routes for destinations. If no appropriate route or backup exists in the routing table, EIGRP will query neighbor routers to discover an alternate route. In this manner, EIGRP can quickly adapt to alternate routes when changes occur.<br><br>• Low use of network resources. During normal operation EIGRP transmits only hello packets across the network. EIGRP does not send periodic routing updates like RIP and IGRP. When change occurs, only routing table changes are propagated in EIGRP not the entire table. This minimizes bandwidth usage.<br><br>• Automatic classful route summarization at major network boundaries is the default in EIGRP. Unlike IGRP and RIP, manual route summarization can also be configured on arbitrary network boundaries to reduce the routing table size.<br><br>• Multiple protocol support. EIGRP can exchange routes for IP, AppleTalk and IPX/SPX networks.<br><br>OSPF, not EIGRP, is an open standard that operates within a controlled hierarchy, performs automatic classless route summarization, and uses areas.",
