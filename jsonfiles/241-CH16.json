            "explanation":"802.1x--a port-based protocol that provides an authentication method for devices attempting to establish a wired or wireless network connection. When ports are configured to used 802.1x, devices are required to provide credentials in order to connect to the network. 802.1x is composed of the following components:<br>• Supplicant – The device or user that is requesting access to the network<br>• Authenticator – The network device (e.g., a switch or WAP) to which the supplicant is connected.<br>• Authentication server – The server responsible for authenticating the supplicant; this is typically a RADIUS server.<br>802.1x uses the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) to exchange authentication messages.<br>DHCP snooping--provides Layer 2 security by dropping any DHCP traffic that has not been authorized by the network switch. This protects against rogue DHCP servers being connected to the network and performing man-in-the-middle attacks. DHCP snooping also protects against network issues caused by an employee connecting a DHCP device (such as a consumer-grade router) to a network port.<br>Non-default native VLAN--By default, Cisco switches use VLAN 1 as the native VLAN. This VLAN is used to send management information between switches (e.g., CDP packets). Because this default VLAN number is known, and because VLANs are a common attack vector, it is recommended to change the default native VLAN on switches to another VLAN number (e.g., VLAN 10).",

The operating system within the virtual machine must have the appropriate driver installed to support the virtual network interface, just as with a physical network interface.<br>Virtual switches--allow one virtual machine to communicate with another in much the same way that a physical switch allows physical hosts to communicate with each other. A virtual switch functions in the same manner as a physical switch: after initially coming online, a virtual switch floods each frame it receives until it builds a table that identifies which MAC addresses are connected to each port.<br>Virtual routers--unlike a physical router, a virtual router can support multiple networks on each router interface. A different routing table is used for each network. This is useful in situations where multiple virtual networks exist on the same physical network. As with physical routers, a routing protocol is used by the virtual router to route data between networks.<br>Virtual firewalls--virtual hosts are susceptible to the same network exploits as physical network hosts and need to be protected by a firewall. Protecting communications between virtual hosts is challenging because the data never leaves the virtual network, so it can't be protected with a physical firewall. One strategy is to implement a virtual firewall within the hypervisor to monitor and filter traffic on the virtual network as it flows between virtual machines.<br>Virtual VLANs--most virtual switch implementations support VLANs. You can define VLANs within a virtual switch and associate specific hosts with a specific VLAN. However, because virtual hosts are not physically connected to switches with cables, VLAN membership is defined within the configuration of each virtual machine.",
