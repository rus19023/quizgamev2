In some cases, convergence can be almost instantaneous because an EIGRP router stores backup routes for destinations. If no appropriate route or backup exists in the routing table, EIGRP will query neighbor routers to discover an alternate route. In this manner, EIGRP can quickly adapt to alternate routes when changes occur. <br>Automatic classful route summarization at major network boundaries is the default in EIGRP. Unlike IGRP and RIP, manual route summarization can also be configured on arbitrary network boundaries to reduce the routing table size. <br>Low use of network resources. During normal operation EIGRP transmits only hello packets across the network. EIGRP does not send periodic routing updates like RIP and IGRP. When change occurs, only routing table changes are propagated in EIGRP not the entire table. This minimizes bandwidth usage. <br>Multiple protocol support. EIGRP can exchange routes for IP, AppleTalk and IPX/SPX networks. <br>OSPF, not EIGRP is an open standard, operates within a controlled hierarchy, performs automatic classless route summarization, and uses areas.",
