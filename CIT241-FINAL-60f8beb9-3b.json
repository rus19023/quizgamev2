When choosing a DR, routers use the following process: <br>The router with the highest OSPF priority set on the interface becomes the DR.<br>If the priority value is not set, it defaults to 1, meaning all routers have the same priority. In this case, the highest router ID is used. The router ID for a router might come from three sources (used in this order):<br>The router ID configured for the OSPF process.<br>The highest IP address assigned to all loopback interfaces.<br>The highest IP address assigned to any remaining interface that is up.<br>In this example, both routers have the same priority, so the router ID is used.<br>Neither router has a router ID configured for the OSPF process.<br>RouterA has a loopback interface, so this becomes its router ID (199.1.1.1).<br>RouterB does not have a loopback interface, so the highest IP address for any of its up interfaces becomes its router ID (172.18.1.12).",

In some cases, convergence can be almost instantaneous because an EIGRP router stores backup routes for destinations. If no appropriate route or backup exists in the routing table, EIGRP will query neighbor routers to discover an alternate route. In this manner, EIGRP can quickly adapt to alternate routes when changes occur. <br>Automatic classful route summarization at major network boundaries is the default in EIGRP. Unlike IGRP and RIP, manual route summarization can also be configured on arbitrary network boundaries to reduce the routing table size. <br>Low use of network resources. During normal operation EIGRP transmits only hello packets across the network. EIGRP does not send periodic routing updates like RIP and IGRP. When change occurs, only routing table changes are propagated in EIGRP not the entire table. This minimizes bandwidth usage. <br>Multiple protocol support. EIGRP can exchange routes for IP, AppleTalk and IPX/SPX networks. <br>OSPF, not EIGRP is an open standard, operates within a controlled hierarchy, performs automatic classless route summarization, and uses areas.",

                "incorrect_answers__003":"Operates within a controlled hierarchy AND Supports multiple protocols",
                "explanation":"The major characteristics of EIGRP include:\r\n• Rapid convergence times for changes in the network topology. In some cases, convergence can be almost instantaneous because an EIGRP router stores backup routes for destinations. If no appropriate route or backup exists in the routing table, EIGRP will query neighbor routers to discover an alternate route. In this manner, EIGRP can quickly adapt to alternate routes when changes occur.\r\n• Low use of network resources. During normal operation EIGRP transmits only hello packets across the network. EIGRP does not send periodic routing updates like RIP and IGRP. When change occurs, only routing table changes are propagated in EIGRP not the entire table. This minimizes bandwidth usage.\r\n• Automatic classful route summarization at major network boundaries is the default in EIGRP. Unlike IGRP and RIP, manual route summarization can also be configured on arbitrary network boundaries to reduce the routing table size.\r\n• Multiple protocol support. EIGRP can exchange routes for IP, AppleTalk and IPX/SPX networks.\r\nOSPF, not EIGRP, is an open standard that operates within a controlled hierarchy, performs automatic classless route summarization, and uses areas.",
